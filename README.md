# Concat_Addin

This is a simple VSTO Excel add-in that allows data in a range to be concatenated.  Some useful features of the add-in are:

* Wrap text in apostrophes or any other user specified character e.g. Banana,Apple becomes 'Apple','Banana'.   This is useful when that data is to be used in a SQL statement.
* Eliminate duplicate values
* Concatenate strings together with any character (defaults to comma)
* Transform text to upper or lower case

The add-in is very performant and can easily handle many thousands of values.
